# Corona-News
The Discord bot I planned out over the course of a college day and then made within around 7 hours. I have added to it since of course, and done lots of bug fixing - I hoped it would accelerate my attention as a discord bot developer, and becoming the first on the front page of new bots in Discord Bot List allowed my bots to go from around 100 servers to thousands. It still remains a helpful tool to report on the Coronavirus pandemic, and I'm pretty proud of it.

It offered something which I saw no other discord bot do at the time, which was live statistics in Discord voice channels for coronavirus statistics - not just in any country, but also any US state.
